We want to build an application for our weekly "ai in action" group where we show demos and share knowledge.

# IDEAS
- show the timeline for next talk / past talks
- countdown timer + speaker notes
- question queue

## Later

- backend for the timeline

- link resources for each talk
- (Speech to text) summary - for those not able to attend?  ðŸ™ƒ 
- summarization + rag document extraction
- preparation bot to help people get their demos right

## Tech stack

- go
- echo routing framework
- templ.guide templating language
- bootstrap 5 for styling
- htmx for interactivity
- sqlite/sql for database
- gorm for ORM
- cobra for CLI
