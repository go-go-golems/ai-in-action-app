## AI in Action App Implementation Plan

Created a detailed implementation plan for the AI in Action app with the following components:

- HTML structure as YAML DSL for Timeline, Timer & Notes, and Question Queue pages
- Domain model definitions for Event, Timer, Note, and Question
- Repository interface definitions with mock implementations
- API handler specifications with HTMX support
- Step-by-step implementation plan with code snippets

The plan follows the repository pattern with mock implementations for data storage and uses Go, templ, htmx, and Bootstrap as specified in the requirements.

## Project Setup and Repository Implementation

Implemented the first four steps of the plan:

1. Set up project structure and Go module
2. Implemented domain models for Event, Timer, Note, and Question
3. Created repository interfaces for data operations
4. Implemented mock repositories with in-memory storage and sample data

The implementation includes thread-safe operations using mutexes and follows Go best practices. A simple main.go file was created to verify the setup is working correctly.

## Context Support for Repository Pattern

Enhanced the repository pattern implementation with context.Context support:

1. Updated all repository interfaces to accept context.Context as the first parameter
2. Added proper error handling with return types for all repository methods
3. Implemented context cancellation checks in all repository methods
4. Updated the main.go file to use context with timeout for all repository calls

This change follows Go best practices for context propagation and cancellation support, making the codebase more robust for handling timeouts and cancellations.
