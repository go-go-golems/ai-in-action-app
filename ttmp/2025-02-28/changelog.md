## AI in Action App Implementation Plan

Created a detailed implementation plan for the AI in Action app with the following components:

- HTML structure as YAML DSL for Timeline, Timer & Notes, and Question Queue pages
- Domain model definitions for Event, Timer, Note, and Question
- Repository interface definitions with mock implementations
- API handler specifications with HTMX support
- Step-by-step implementation plan with code snippets

The plan follows the repository pattern with mock implementations for data storage and uses Go, templ, htmx, and Bootstrap as specified in the requirements.

## Project Setup and Repository Implementation

Implemented the first four steps of the plan:

1. Set up project structure and Go module
2. Implemented domain models for Event, Timer, Note, and Question
3. Created repository interfaces for data operations
4. Implemented mock repositories with in-memory storage and sample data

The implementation includes thread-safe operations using mutexes and follows Go best practices. A simple main.go file was created to verify the setup is working correctly.
