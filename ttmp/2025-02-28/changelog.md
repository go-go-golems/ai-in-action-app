# Changelog for 2025-02-28

## AI in Action App Implementation Plan

Created a detailed implementation plan for the AI in Action app with the following components:

- HTML structure as YAML DSL for Timeline, Timer & Notes, and Question Queue pages
- Domain model definitions for Event, Timer, Note, and Question
- Repository interface definitions with mock implementations
- API handler specifications with HTMX support
- Step-by-step implementation plan with code snippets

The plan follows the repository pattern with mock implementations for data storage and uses Go, templ, htmx, and Bootstrap as specified in the requirements.

## Project Setup and Repository Implementation

Implemented the first four steps of the plan:

1. Set up project structure and Go module
2. Implemented domain models for Event, Timer, Note, and Question
3. Created repository interfaces for data operations
4. Implemented mock repositories with in-memory storage and sample data

The implementation includes thread-safe operations using mutexes and follows Go best practices. A simple main.go file was created to verify the setup is working correctly.

## Context Support for Repository Pattern

Enhanced the repository pattern implementation with context.Context support:

1. Updated all repository interfaces to accept context.Context as the first parameter
2. Added proper error handling with return types for all repository methods
3. Implemented context cancellation checks in all repository methods
4. Updated the main.go file to use context with timeout for all repository calls

This change follows Go best practices for context propagation and cancellation support, making the codebase more robust for handling timeouts and cancellations.

## HTMX Partial Updates Optimization

Optimized HTMX updates to only refresh the content area without reloading the navbar:

- Created a new `TimelineContent` template component that renders only the timeline content without the full page layout
- Updated the event handler to detect HTMX requests and render only the content portion
- This improves performance and provides a smoother user experience by avoiding unnecessary DOM updates 

## Modal Closing Enhancement

Improved modal handling in the application:

- Enhanced the modal closing mechanism to ensure modals are properly closed after form submission
- Added a global closeModal function in app.js for consistent modal handling
- Implemented a global HTMX event listener to automatically close modals after successful form submissions
- Added fallback mechanisms to handle edge cases where modal instances might not be available 

## Project Documentation with Cursor Rules

Added comprehensive documentation as Cursor rules to improve AI assistance and developer onboarding:

- Created project-overview.mdc with general project information and structure
- Added tech-stack.mdc detailing the technology stack and development practices
- Documented feature-ideas.mdc with current and planned features
- Established coding-standards.mdc with language-specific best practices
- Created database-guidelines.mdc for data modeling and access patterns
- Added ui-ux-guidelines.mdc for frontend development standards

These rules provide contextual guidance for AI assistants and developers working with the codebase, ensuring consistent implementation and adherence to project standards.

## Repository Selection with Cobra CLI

Enhanced the application with a command-line interface using Cobra:

- Refactored main.go to use Cobra for command-line argument parsing
- Added a `--sqlite` flag to switch between mock and SQLite repositories
- Implemented a `--db-path` flag to specify the SQLite database file location
- Added a `--port` flag to configure the server port
- Improved error handling with github.com/pkg/errors for better error context

This change allows users to easily switch between in-memory mock repositories for development and SQLite repositories for production use, making the application more flexible and configurable.

## SQLite Repository Bug Fix

Fixed a type mismatch error in the SQLite note repository:

- Changed the `totalPages` variable from `int` to `int64` to match GORM's `Count()` method expectations
- Added proper type conversion when assigning the count result back to the domain model
- This fix resolves a compilation error that occurred when using the SQLite repository implementation

The fix ensures compatibility with GORM's API which expects `*int64` for count operations.
